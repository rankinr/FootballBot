The one, the only, FootballBot, as seen in #redditcfb on FreeNode.

If you have any suggestions, please let me - harkatmuld on FreeNode and Reddit - know, or push a change and I'll take a look.

Many thanks to Dublock for his assistance in troubleshooting much of the bot, and to Ryumast3r for his help troubleshooting some early aspects of the !me command.
